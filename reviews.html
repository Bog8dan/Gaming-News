    <p>Even though the trailer for Konami’s remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is just over two minutes long, it’s packed with
        easter eggs and nods to the original game if you look hard enough. Some of them may be blink-and-you’ll-miss-it
        moments, but don’t worry! We’re here to help you spot them all. These are the 11 details you may have missed
        when watching the trailer.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Shagohod Incoming</h2>
    <p>One of the coolest details was just under a minute into the trailer, when the green parrot (more on that later)
        is swooping above the canopy of the forest, a dead frog in its claws. But it’s what’s in the distance that’s
        interesting, because when lightning lights up the sky it’s possible to make out the shape of the Shagohod being
        airlifted by several Mil Mi-24 Hind Helicopters. This is a direct reference to what happens in the game, as
        Volgin readies the Shagohod to take over the USSR. While it’s too far away to see it in detail in the trailer,
        we’ll definitely be getting much more up close and personal with it in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Friend of The End</h2>
    <p>The green parrot that has more air time in the trailer than Snake himself has to be the feathered-friend of
        ancient sniper The End. Anyone who played Snake Eater will remember how the parrot acted as The End’s spotter,
        waking him when Snake approaches. Some days you just have to feed on a tree frog. The parrot appears to agree,
        clutching a tree frog which it carries through the dark sky before landing on a floating log in the middle of a
        lake. Moments later, a huge snake bursts from the water and snaps at the parrot, which narrowly escapes, minus a
        few feathers.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Crocodile Rock</h2>
    <p>Just as the snake pounces on the parrot, it is attacked by an Indian Gavial, which if you remember can be
        captured and eaten in Metal Gear Solid 3. It’s hard to make out in the trailer, but a screenshot released
        alongside the announcement gives us a better look at the croc and its pointy snout. It’s also the basis for one
        of the most amusing cosmetics in the game, the Crocodile Cap, which when worn in the water can trick enemies
        into thinking you’re a deadly animal, instead of just the world’s deadliest man.</p>
