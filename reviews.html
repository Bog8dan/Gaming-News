    <h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – 11 Details You May have Missed in the Trailer</h2>

    <p>Even though the trailer for Konami’s remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is just over two minutes long, it’s packed with
        easter eggs and nods to the original game if you look hard enough. Some of them may be blink-and-you’ll-miss-it
        moments, but don’t worry! We’re here to help you spot them all. These are the 11 details you may have missed
        when watching the trailer.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Shagohod Incoming</h2>
    <p>One of the coolest details was just under a minute into the trailer, when the green parrot (more on that later)
        is swooping above the canopy of the forest, a dead frog in its claws. But it’s what’s in the distance that’s
        interesting, because when lightning lights up the sky it’s possible to make out the shape of the Shagohod being
        airlifted by several Mil Mi-24 Hind Helicopters. This is a direct reference to what happens in the game, as
        Volgin readies the Shagohod to take over the USSR. While it’s too far away to see it in detail in the trailer,
        we’ll definitely be getting much more up close and personal with it in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Friend of The End</h2>
    <p>The green parrot that has more air time in the trailer than Snake himself has to be the feathered-friend of
        ancient sniper The End. Anyone who played Snake Eater will remember how the parrot acted as The End’s spotter,
        waking him when Snake approaches. Some days you just have to feed on a tree frog. The parrot appears to agree,
        clutching a tree frog which it carries through the dark sky before landing on a floating log in the middle of a
        lake. Moments later, a huge snake bursts from the water and snaps at the parrot, which narrowly escapes, minus a
        few feathers.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Crocodile Rock</h2>
    <p>Just as the snake pounces on the parrot, it is attacked by an Indian Gavial, which if you remember can be
        captured and eaten in Metal Gear Solid 3. It’s hard to make out in the trailer, but a screenshot released
        alongside the announcement gives us a better look at the croc and its pointy snout. It’s also the basis for one
        of the most amusing cosmetics in the game, the Crocodile Cap, which when worn in the water can trick enemies
        into thinking you’re a deadly animal, instead of just the world’s deadliest man.</p>

    <h2>Blizzard Leadership Interview: Discussing Diablo 4's Endgame and Live-Service Future</h2>
    <div>
        <iframe class="media-align" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ro26B394ZBM" title="YouTube video player"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"

    </div>
    <p>In the days before Diablo 4's launch, the leadership team at Blizzard was already all too excited to discuss the
        endgame and imminent live-service future for their ARPG, which dives into the GaaS model for the first time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently in their pre-season phase, Blizzard has mostly been hesitant to discuss what's next with the fires of
        Hell still burning so fresh, but with teams already hard at work on seasonal content and full expansions, we sat
        down to talk to Rod Fergusson, the general manager of Diablo, and Zaven Haroutunian, associate game director for
        Diablo, about their vision for Diablo's endless grind.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Zaven Haroutunian, Associate Game Director: When we shipped Diablo 3, we didn't really have a live-service plan
        in place. We just thought "we can patch the game as a support thing and [develop] Reapers of Souls." That's when
        seasons started and even then it took a while to really turn into what we have today, which is super awesome.
        With Diablo 4, we're planning for that level of support, and more, out the gate. So we're already talking about
        season one. We're already talking about live-service. We're building the game with these things in mind from the
        get-go.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Diablo 3 was really about adding mechanics and balance and making certain things overpowered for fun and all
        those sorts of things, where Diablo 4 will have a richer context around the season and also have a narrative
        theme that you're working toward and that all the things will relate to: the cosmetics relate to it, the
        mechanics will relate to it. There will be a narrative questline that won't extend the campaign, but will be a
        story that is taking place inside the open world. Because that's the nice thing about the world is that there's
        lots of stories you can still tell without having it be the Lilith/Inarius story.</p>
